            <p>In his A History of the World War (page 212), Captain Liddell Hart reports that a planned offensive by thirteen British divisions, supported by fourteen hundred artillery pieces, against the German line at Serre-Montauban, scheduled for July 24, 1916, had to be postponed until the morning of the 29th. He comments that torrential rain caused this delay - which lacked any special significance.

Madden, in Viktor Runeberg's  office, meant the end of all our work and - though this seemed a secondary matter,  or should have seemed so to me - of our lives also. His being there meant that  Runeberg had been arrested or murdered. 1 Before the sun set on this same day, I ran  the same risk. Madden was implacable. Rather, to be more accurate, he was obliged  to be implacable. </p>
