        <p>In his A History of the World War (page 212), Captain Liddell Hart reports that a planned offensive by thirteen British divisions, supported by fourteen hundred artillery pieces, against the German line at Serre-Montauban, scheduled for July 24, 1916, had to be postponed until the morning of the 29th. He comments that torrential rain caused this delay - which lacked any special significance. The following deposition, dictated by, read over, and then signed by Dr. Yu Tsun, former teacher of English at the Tsingtao Hochschule, casts unsuspected light upon this event. The first two pages are missing.

                <p> . . and I hung up the phone. Immediately I recollected the voice that had spoken in German. It was that of Captain Richard Madden. Madden, in Viktor Runeberg's office, meant the end of all our work and - though this seemed a secondary matter, or should have seemed so to me - of our lives also. His being there meant that Runeberg had been arrested or murdered. 1 Before the sun set on this same day, I ran the same risk. Madden was implacable: Rather, to be more accurate, he was obliged to be implacable.

            <p> An Irishman in the service of England, a man suspected of equivocal feelings if not of actual treachery, how could he fail to welcome and seize upon this extraordinary piece of luck: the discovery, capture and perhaps the deaths of two agents of Imperial Germany?

                    In the midst of my hatred and terror (now that it no longer matters to me to speak of terror, now that it no longer matters to me), I knew that my neck hankers for the hangman's noose. I knew that the fast-moving and doubtless happy soldier did not suspect that I possessed the Secret - the name of the exact site of the new British artillery park on the Ancre. A bird streaked across the misty sky and, absently, I turned it into an airplane and then that airplane into many in the sky of France) annihilating the artillery park under a rain of bombs. If only my mouth, before it should be silenced by a bullet, could cry out this name in such a way that it could be heard in Germany ... My voice, my human voice, was very weak. How could it reach the ear of the Chief? The ear of that sick and hateful man who knew nothing of Runeberg or of me except that we were in Staffordshire. A man who, sitting in his Berlin office, leafed infinitely through newspapers, looking in vain for news from us. I said aloud, 'I must flee.'

             <p>I sat up on the bed, in senseless and perfect silence, as if Madden was already peering  at me. Something - perhaps merely a desire to prove my total penury to myself -  made me empty out my pockets. I found just what I knew I was going to find. The  American watch, the nickel-plated chain and the square coin, the key ring with the  useless but compromising keys to Runeberg's office, the notebook, a letter which I  decided to destroy at once (and which I did not destroy), a five shilling piece, two  single shillings and some pennies, a red and blue pencil, a handkerchief - and a  revolver with a single bullet. Absurdly I held it and weighed it in my hand, to give  myself courage. Vaguely I thought that a pistol shot can be heard for a great distance.   In ten minutes I had developed my plan. The telephone directory gave me the name  of the one person capable of passing on the information. He lived in a suburb of  Fenton, less than half an hour away by train.   I am a timorous man. I can say it now, now that I have brought my incredibly risky  plan to an end. It was not easy to bring about, and I know that its execution was  terrible. I did not do it for Germany - no! Such a barbarous country is of no  importance to me, particularly since it had degraded me by making me become a spy.  Furthermore, I knew an Englishman - a modest man - who, for me, is as great as  Goethe. I did not speak with him for more than an hour, but during that time, he  was Goethe.   I carried out my plan because I felt the Chief had some fear of those of my race, of  those uncountable forebears whose culmination lies in me. I wished to prove to him  that a yellow man could save his armies. Besides, I had to escape the Captain.</p>
