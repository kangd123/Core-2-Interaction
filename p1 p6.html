        <p>His  hands and voice could, at any moment, knock and beckon at my door.Silently, I dressed, took leave of myself in the mirror, went down the stairs, sneaked  a look at the quiet street, and went out. The station was not far from my house, but  I thought it more prudent to take a cab. I told myself that I thus ran less chance of  being recognized. The truth is that, in the deserted street, I felt infinitely visible and  vulnerable. I recall that I told the driver to stop short of the main entrance. I got out  with a painful and deliberate slowness. I was going to the village of Ashgrove, but took a ticket for a station further on. The  train would leave in a few minutes, at eight-fifty. I hurried, for the next would not go  until half past nine. There was almost no one on the platform. I walked through the  carriages. I remember some farmers, a woman dressed in mourning, a youth deep in  Tacitus' Annals and a wounded, happy soldier.

                <p> At last the train pulled out. A man I recognized ran furiously, but vainly, the length of  the platform. It was Captain Richard Madden. Shattered, trembling, I huddled in the  distant corner of the seat, as far as possible from the fearful window. From utter terror I passed into a state of almost abject happiness. I told myself that  the duel had already started and that I had won the first encounter by besting my  adversary in his first attack - even if it was only for forty minutes - by an accident of  fate. I argued that so small a victory prefigured a total victory. I argued that it was not so trivial, that were it not for the precious accident of the train schedule, I  would be in prison or dead. I argued, with no less sophism, that my timorous  happiness was proof that I was man enough to bring this adventure to a successful  conclusion. From my weakness I drew strength that never left me. I foresee that man will resign himself each day to new abominations, that soon only  soldiers and bandits will be left.

            <p1> To them I offer this advice: Whosoever would  undertake some atrocious enterprise should act as if it were already accomplished,  should impose upon himself a future as irrevocable as the past.   Thus I proceeded, while with the eyes of a man already dead, I contemplated the  fluctuations of the day which would probably be my last, and watched the diffuse  coming of night.   The train crept along gently, amid ash trees. It slowed down and stopped, almost in  the middle of a field. No one called the name of a station. "Ashgrove?" I asked some  children on the platform. "Ashgrove," they replied. I got out.   A lamp lit the platform, but the children's faces remained in a shadow. One of them  asked me: "Are you going to Dr. Stephen Albert's house?" Without waiting for my  answer, another said: "The house is a good distance away but you won't get lost if  you take the road to the left and bear to the left at every crossroad." I threw them a  coin (my last), went down some stone steps and started along a deserted road. At a  slight incline, the road ran downhill. It was a plain dirt way, and overhead the  branches of trees intermingled, while a round moon hung low in the sky as if to keep  me company.   For a moment I thought that Richard Madden might in some way have divined my  desperate intent. At once I realized that this would be impossible. The advice about  turning always to the left reminded me that such was the common formula for  finding the central courtyard of certain labyrinths. I know something about  labyrinths. Not for nothing am I the greatgrandson of Ts'ui Pen.

            <p2>He was Governor of  Yunnan and gave up temporal power to write a novel with more characters than  there are in the Hung Lou Meng, and to create a maze in which all men would lose  themselves. He spent thirteen years on these oddly assorted tasks before he was  assassinated by a stranger. His novel had no sense to it and nobody ever found his  labyrinth.   Under the trees of England I meditated on this lost and perhaps mythical labyrinth. I  imagined it untouched and perfect on the secret summit of some mountain; I  imagined it drowned under rice paddies or beneath the sea; I imagined it infinite,  made not only of eight-sided pavilions and of twisting paths but also of rivers,  provinces and kingdoms ... I thought of a maze of mazes, of a sinuous, ever growing  maze which would take in both past and future and would somehow involve the  stars.   Lost in these imaginary illusions I forgot my destiny - that of the hunted. For an  undetermined period of time I felt myself cut off from the world, an abstract  spectator. The hazy and murmuring countryside, the moon, the decline of the  evening, stirred within me. Going down the gently sloping road I could not feel  fatigue. The evening was at once intimate and infinite.

        <p>I remember also  a rose-glazed jar and yet another, older by many centuries, of that blue color which  our potters copied from the Persians . . .   Stephen Albert was watching me with a smile on his face. He was, as I have said,  remarkably tall. His face was deeply lined and he had gray eyes and a gray beard.  There was about him something of the priest, and something of the sailor. Later, he    4     told me he had been a missionary in Tientsin before he "had aspired to become a  Sinologist."   We sat down, I upon a large, low divan, he with his back to the window and to a  large circular clock. I calculated that my pursuer, Richard Madden, could not arrive in  less than an hour. My irrevocable decision could wait.   "A strange destiny," said Stephen Albert, "that of Ts'ui Pen - Governor of his native  province, learned in astronomy, in astrology and tireless in the interpretation of the  canonical books, a chess player, a famous poet and a calligrapher. Yet he abandoned  all to make a book and a labyrinth. He gave up all the pleasures of oppression,  justice, of a well-stocked bed, of banquets, and even of erudition, and shut himself up  in the Pavilion of the Limpid Sun for thirteen years. At his death, his heirs found only  a mess of manuscripts. The family, as you doubtless know, wished to consign them  to the fire, but the executor of the estate - a Taoist or a Buddhist monk - insisted on  their publication."   "Those of the blood of Ts'ui Pen," I replied, "still curse the memory of that monk.  Such a publication was madness. The book is a shapeless mass of contradictory  rough drafts. I examined it once upon a time: the hero dies in the third chapter,  while in the fourth he is alive. As for that other enterprise of Ts'ui Pen ... his  Labyrinth . . ."   "Here is the Labyrinth," Albert said, pointing to a tall, laquered writing cabinet.   "An ivory labyrinth?" I exclaimed. "A tiny labyrinth indeed . . . !"   "A symbolic labyrinth," he corrected me. "An invisible labyrinth of time. I, a  barbarous Englishman, have been given the key to this transparent mystery. After  more than a hundred years most of the details are irrecoverable, lost beyond all  recall, but it isn't hard to image what must have happened.

            <p>The Garden of Forking Paths was the chaotic novel itself. The phrase 'to  various future times, but not to all' suggested the image of bifurcating in time, not in  space. Rereading the whole work confirmed this theory. In all fiction, when a man is  faced with alternatives he chooses one at the expense of the others. In the almost  unfathomable Ts'ui Pen, he chooses - simultaneously - all of them. He thus creates  various futures, various times which start others that will in their turn branch out  and bifurcate in other times. This is the cause of the contradictions in the novel.   "Fang, let us say, has a secret. A stranger knocks at his door. Fang makes up his mind  to kill him. Naturally there are various possible outcomes. Fang can kill the intruder,  the intruder can kill Fang, both can be saved, both can die and so on and so on. In  Ts'ui Pen's work, all the possible solutions occur, each one being the point of  departure for other bifurcations. Sometimes the pathways of this labyrinth converge.  For example, you come to this house; but in other possible pasts you are my enemy;  in others my friend.   "If you will put up with my atrocious pronunciation, I would like to read you a few  pages of your ancestor's work."   His countenance, in the bright circle of lamplight, was certainly that of an ancient, but  it shone with something unyielding, even immortal.   With slow precision, he read two versions of the same epic chapter. In the first, an  army marches into battle over a desolate mountain pass. The bleak and somber  aspect of the rocky landscape made the soldiers feel that life itself was of little value,  and so they won the battle easily.
