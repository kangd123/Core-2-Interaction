                <p>The road kept descending and branching off, through meadows misty in the twilight.  A high-pitched and almost syllabic music kept coming and going, moving with the  breeze, blurred by the leaves and by distance.   I thought that a man might be an enemy of other men, of the differing moments of  other men, but never an enemy of a country: not of fireflies, words, gardens,  streams, or the West wind.Meditating thus I arrived at a high, rusty iron gate. Through the railings I could see an  avenue bordered with poplar trees and also a kind of summer house or pavilion.Two things dawned on me at once, the first trivial and the second almost incredible:  the music came from the pavilion and that music was Chinese. That was why I had  accepted it fully, without paying it any attention. I do not remember whether there  was a bell, a push-button, or whether I attracted attention by clapping my hands. The  stuttering sparks of the music kept on. But from the end of the avenue, from the main house, a lantern approached; a  lantern which alternately, from moment to moment, was crisscrossed or put out by  the trunks of the trees; a paper lantern shaped like a drum and colored like the  moon.

                <p>A tall man carried it. I could not see his face for the light blinded me.   He opened the gate and spoke slowly in my language.   "I see that the worthy Hsi P'eng has troubled himself to see to relieving my solitude.  No doubt you want to see the garden?"   Recognizing the name of one of our consuls, I replied, somewhat taken aback.   "The garden?"   "The garden of forking paths."   Something stirred in my memory and I said, with incomprehensible assurance:   "The garden of my ancestor, Ts'ui Pen."   "Your ancestor? Your illustrious ancestor? Come in."   The damp path zigzagged like those of my childhood. When we reached the house,  we went into a library filled with books from both East and West. I recognized some  large volumes bound in yellow silk-manuscripts of the Lost Encyclopedia which was  edited by the Third Emperor of the Luminous Dynasty. They had never been  printed. A phonograph record was spinning near a bronze phoenix.
