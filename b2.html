        The  line  is  made  up  of  an  infinite  number  of  points;  the  plane  of  an  infinite  number  of  lines;  the  volume  of  an  infinite  number  of  planes;  the  hypervolume  of  an  infinite  number  of  volumes.  .  .  .  No,  unquestionably  this  is  not — more  geome-  trico — the  best  way  of  beginning  my  story.  To  claim  that  it  is  true  is  nowadays  the  convention  of  every  made-up  story.  Mine,  however,  is  true.   I  live  alone  in  a  fourth-floor  apartment  on  Bel-  grano  Street,  in  Buenos  Aires.  Late  one  evening,  a  few  months  back,  I  heard  a  knock  at  my  door.  I  opened  it  and  a  stranger  stood  there.  He  was  a  tall  man,  with  nondescript  features — or  perhaps  it  was  my  myopia  that  made  them  seem  that  way.  Dressed  in  gray  and  carrying  a  gray  suitcase  in  his  hand,  he  had  an  unassuming  look  about  him.  I  saw  at  once  that  he  was  a  foreigner.  At  first,  he  struck  me  as  old;  only  later  did  I  realize  that  I  had  been  misled  by  his  thin  blond  hair,  which  was,  in  a  Scandinavian  sort  of  way,  almost  white.  During  the  course  of  our  conversation,  which  was  not  to  last  an  hour,  I  found  out  that  he  came  from  the  Ork-  neys.    117    I  invited  him  in,  pointing  to  a  chair.  He  paused  awhile  before  speaking.  A  kind  of  gloom  ema-  nated from  him — as  it  does  now  from  me.   "I  sell  Bibles,"  he  said.   Somewhat  pedantically,  I  replied,  "In  this  house  are  several  English  Bibles,  including  the  first —  John  Wiclif's.  I  also  have  Cipriano  de  Valera's,  Luther's — which,  from  a  literary  viewpoint,  is  the  worst — and  a  Latin  copy  of  the  Vulgate.  As  you  see,  it's  not  exactly  Bibles  I  stand  in  need  of."   After  a  few  moments  of  silence,  he  said,  "I  don't  only  sell  Bibles.  I  can  show  you  a  holy  book  I  came  across  on  the  outskirts  of  Bikaner.  It  may  interest  you."   He  opened  the  suitcase  and  laid  the  book  on  a  table.  It  was  an  octavo  volume,  bound  in  cloth.  There  was  no  doubt  that  it  had  passed  through  many  hands.  Examining  it,  I  was  surprised  by  its  unusual  weight.  On  the  spine  were  the  words  "Holy  Writ"  and,  below  them,  "Bombay."   "Nineteenth  century,  probably,"  I  remarked.   "I  don't  know,"  he  said.  "I've  never  found  out."   I  opened  the  book  at  random.  The  script  was  strange  to  me.  The  pages,  which  were  worn  and  typographically  poor,  were  laid  out  in  double  col-  umns, as  in  a  Bible.  The  text  was  closely  printed,  and  it  was  ordered  in  versicles.  In  the  upper  corners  of  the  pages  were  Arabic  numbers.  I  no-  ticed that  one  left-hand  page  bore  the  number  (let  us  say)  40,514  and  the  facing  right-hand  page  999.  I  turned  the  leaf;  it  was  numbered  with  eight  digits.  It  also  bore  a  small  illustration,  like  the  kind  used  in  dictionaries — an  anchor  drawn  with  pen  and  ink,  as  if  by  a  schoolboy's  clumsy  hand.

It  was  at  this  point  that  the  stranger  said,  "Look   118    at  the  illustration  closely.  You'll  never  see  it  again."   I  noted  my  place  and  closed  the  book.  At  once,  I  reopened  it.  Page  by  page,  in  vain,  I  looked  for  the  illustration  of  the  anchor.  "It  seems  to  be  a  version  of  Scriptures  in  some  Indian  language,  is  it  not?"  I  said  to  hide  my  dismay.   "No,"  he  replied.  Then,  as  if  confiding  a  secret,  he  lowered  his  voice.  "I  acquired  the  book  in  a  town  out  on  the  plain  in  exchange  for  a  handful  of  rupees  and  a  Bible.  Its  owner  did  not  know  how  to  read.

        I  srspect  that  heㅎ  saw  the  Book  of  Books  as  a  talisman.  He  was  of  the  lowest  caste;  nobody  but  other  untouchables  could  tread  his  shadow  with-  out contamination.  He  told  me  his  book  was  called  the  Book  of  Sand,  because  neither  the  book  nor  the  sand  has  any  beginning  or  end."   The  stranger  asked  me  to  find  the  first  page.   I  laid  my  left  hand  on  the  cover  and,  trying  to  put  my  thumb  on  the  flyleaf,  I  opened  the  book.  It  was  useless.  Every  time  I  tried,  a  number  of  pages  came  between  the  cover  and  my  thumb.  It  was  as  if  they  kept  growing  from  the  book.   "Now  find  the  last  page."   Again  I  failed.  In  a  voice  that  was  not  mine,  I  barely  managed  to  stammer,  "This  can't  be."   Still  speaking  in  a  low  voice,  the  stranger  said,  "It  can't  be,  but  it  is.  The  number  of  pages  in  this  book  is  no  more  or  less  than  infinite.  None  is  the  first  page,  none  the  last.  I  don't  know  why  they're  numbered  in  this  arbitrary  way.  Perhaps  to  suggest  that  the  terms  of  an  infinite  series  admit  any  number."   Then,  as  if  he  were  thinking  aloud,  he  said,  "If  space  is  infinite,  we  may  be  at  any  point  in  space.  If  time  is  infinite,  we  may  be  at  any  point  in  time."    •'9    His  speculations  irritated  me.  "You  are  re-  ligious, no  doubt?"  I  asked  him.   "Yes,  I'm  a  Presbyterian.  My  conscience  is  clear.  I  am  reasonably  sure  of  not  having  cheated  the  na-  tive when  I  gave  him  the  Word  of  God  in  ex-  change for  his  devilish  book."   I  assured  him  that  he  had  nothing  to  reproach  himself  for,  and  I  asked  if  he  were  just  passing  through  this  part  of  the  world.  He  replied  that  he  planned  to  return  to  his  country  in  a  few  days.  It  was  then  that  I  learned  that  he  was  a  Scot  from  the  Orkney  Islands.  I  told  him  I  had  a  great  personal  affection  for  Scotland,  through  my  love  of  Steven-  son and  Hume.   "You  mean  Stevenson  and  Robbie  Burns,"  he  corrected.   While  we  spoke,  I  kept  exploring  the  infinite  book.  With  feigned  indifference,  I  asked,  "Do  you  intend  to  offer  this  curiosity  to  the  British  Mu-  seum?"   "No.  I'm  offering  it  to  you,"  he  said,  and  he  stipulated  a  rather  high  sum  for  the  book.   I  answered,  in  all  truthfulness,  that  such  a  sum  was  out  of  my  reach,  and  I  began  thinking.  After  a  minute  or  two,  I  came  up  with  a  scheme.   "I  propose  a  swap,"

        I  said.  "You  got  this  book  for  a  handful  of  rupees  and  a  copy  of  the  Bible.  I'll  offer  you  the  amount  of  my  pension  check,  which  I've  just  collected,  and  my  black-letter  Wiclif  Bible.  I  inherited  it  from  my  ancestors."   "A  black-letter  Wiclif!"  he  murmured.   I  went  to  my  bedroom  and  brought  him  the  money  and  the  book.  He  turned  the  leaves  and  studied  the  title  page  with  all  the  fervor  of  a  true  bibliophile.    120    "It's  a  deal,"  he  said.   It  amazed  me  that  he  did  not  haggle.  Only  later  was  I  to  realize  that  he  had  entered  my  house  with  his  mind  made  up  to  sell  the  book.  Without  count-  ing the  money,  he  put  it  away.   We  talked  about  India,  about  Orkney,  and  about  the  Norwegian  jails  who  once  ruled  it.  It  was  night  when  the  man  left.  I  have  not  seen  him  again,  nor  do  I  know  his  name.   I  thought  of  keeping  the  Book  of  Sand  in  the  space  left  on  the  shelf  by  the  Wiclif,  but  in  the  end  I  decided  to  hide  it  behind  the  volumes  of  a  bro-  ken set  of  The  Thousand  and  One  Nights.  I  went  to  bed  and  did  not  sleep.  At  three  or  four  in  the  morning,  I  turned  on  the  light.  I  got  down  the  im-  possible book  and  leafed  through  its  pages.  On  one  of  them  I  saw  engraved  a  mask.  The  upper  corner  of  the  page  carried  a  number,  which  I  no  longer  recall,  elevated  to  the  ninth  power.   I  showed  no  one  my  treasure.  To  the  luck  of  owning  it  was  added  the  fear  of  having  it  stolen,  and  then  the  misgiving  that  it  might  not  truly  be  infinite.  These  twin  preoccupations  intensified  my  old  misanthropy.  I  had  only  a  few  friends  left;  I  now  stopped  seeing  even  them.  A  prisoner  of  the  book,  I  almost  never  went  out  anymore.  After  studying  its  frayed  spine  and  covers  with  a  magni-  fying glass,  I  rejected  the  possibility  of  a  contriv-  ance of  any  sort.  The  small  illustrations,  I  verified,  came  two  thousand  pages  apart.  I  set  about  listing  them  alphabetically  in  a  notebook,  which  I  was  not  long  in  filling  up.  Never  once  was  an  illustration  repeated.  At  night,  in  the  meager  intervals  my  in-  somnia granted,  I  dreamed  of  the  book.   Summer  came  and  went,  and  I  realized  that  the    book  was  monstrous.  What  good  did  it  do  me  to  think  that  I,  who  looked  upon  the  volume  with  my  eyes,  who  held  it  in  my  hands,  was  any  less  mon-  strous?

        I  felt  that  the  book  was  a  nightmarish  ob-  ject, an  obscene  thing  that  affronted  and  tainted  reality  itself.   I  thought  of  fire,  but  I  feared  that  the  burning  of  an  infinite  book  might  likewise  prove  infinite  and  suffocate  the  planet  with  smoke.  Somewhere  I  recalled  reading  that  the  best  place  to  hide  a  leaf  is  in  a  forest.  Before  retirement,  I  worked  on  Mexico  Street,  at  the  Argentine  National  Library,  which  contains  nine  hundred  thousand  volumes.  I  knew  that  to  the  right  of  the  entrance  a  curved  staircase  leads  down  into  the  basement,  where  books  and  maps  and  periodicals  are  kept.  One  day  I  went  there  and,  slipping  past  a  member  of  the  staff  and  trying  not  to  notice  at  what  height  or  distance  from  the  door,  I  lost  the  Book  of  Sand  on  one  of  the  basement's  musty  shelves.    122    Afterword    Prefacing  stories  a  reader  has  not  yet  read,  since  it  demands  the  analysis  of  plots  that  it  may  be  incon-  venient to  deal  with  in  advance,  is  a  somewhat  im-  possible task.  I  therefore  prefer  an  afterword.   The  book's  first  story  takes  up  the  old  theme  of  the  double,  which  several  times  moved  Robert  Louis  Stevenson's  ever-fortunate  pen.  In  England,  its  name  is  "fetch"  or,  more  bookishly,  "wraith  of  the  living";  in  Germany,  "Doppelganger."  One  of  its  earliest  names,  I  suspect,  was  "alter  ego."  This  ghostly  apparition  probably  came  from  mirrors  of  metal  or  from  reflections  in  water  or  simply  from  memory,  which  makes  of  anyone  both  a  spectator  and  an  actor.  In  "The  Other,"  I  had  to  ensure  that  the  speakers  were  sufficiently  different  to  be  two  persons  and  alike  enough  to  be  one.  Is  it  worth  stating  that  the  idea  for  the  story  came  to  me  in  Cambridge  on  the  banks  of  the  Charles  River,  whose  cold  course  reminded  me  of  the  far-off  course  of  the  Rhone?   The  theme  of  love  is  quite  common  in  my  poems  but  not  in  my  prose,  which  offers  no  other    123    example  than  "Ulrike."  The  reader  will  notice  its  formal  affinity  with  "The  Other."   "The  Congress"  is  perhaps  the  most  ambitious  of  the  tales  in  this  book;  its  subject  is  that  of  an  en-  terprise so  vast  that  in  the  end  it  becomes  con-  fused with  the  world  itself  and  with  the  sum  of  daily  life.  Its  opaque  beginning  tries  to  imitate  that  of  a  Kafka  story;  its  end  tries,  doubtless  in  vain,  to  match  the  ecstasies  of  Chesterton  and  John  Bun-  yan.  I  have  never  been  worthy  of  such  a  revela-  tion, but  I  have  managed  to  dream  one  up.  I  have  woven  into  the  story — as  is  my  habit — a  number  of  autobiographical  elements.   Life,  which  everyone  knows  is  inscrutable,  left  me  no  peace  until  I  perpetrated  a  posthumous  story  by  H.  P.  Lovecraft,  a  writer  whom  I  have  always  considered  an  unconscious  parodist  of  Poe.  In  the  end,  I  gave  in;  the  lamentable  fruit  is  en-  titled "There  Are  More  Things."   "The  Sect  of  the  Thirty"  salvages,  without  a  shred  of  documentation,  the  tale  of  a  possible  heresy.   "The  Night  of  the  Gifts"  is  perhaps  the  most  in-  nocent, most  violent,  and  most  exalted  story  of-  fered by  this  collection.

        An  earlier  story  of  mine,  "The  Lottery  of  Babel"  (1941),  imagines  an  infinite  number  of  books;  "Undr"  and  "The  Mirror  and  the  Mask,"  cen-  turies-old literatures  that  are  made  up  of  a  single  line  or  word.   "Utopia  of  a  Tired  Man"  is  in  my  judgment  the  most  honest  and  melancholy  piece  in  the  collec-  tion.   I  have  always  been  amazed  by  the  ethical  obses-    124    sion  of  Americans.  "The  Bribe"  attempts  to  reflect  this  trait.   In  spite  of  John  Felton,  Charlotte  Corday,  the  well-known  opinion  of  Rivera  Indarte  ("It  is  a  holy  act  to  kill  Rosas"),  and  the  Uruguayan  National  Anthem  ("If  they  are  tyrants,  Brutus'  dagger"),  I  do  not  approve  of  political  assassination.  Be  that  as  it  may,  readers  of  Avelino  Arredondo's  solitary  crime  might  wish  to  know  the  story's  outcome.  The  historian  Luis  Melian  Lafinur  asked  for  Ar-  redondo's pardon,  but  his  judges  Carlos  Fein  and  Cristobal  Salvanach  sentenced  him  to  a  month  in  solitary  confinement  and  five  years'  imprisonment.  One  of  the  streets  of  Montevideo  now  bears  Ar-  redondo's name.   Two  opposite  and  inconceivable  concepts  are  the  subjects  of  the  last  two  stories.  "The  Disk"  is  about  the  Euclidean  circle,  which  has  only  one  side;  "The  Book  of  Sand,"  a  volume  of  incalcula-  ble pages.   I  hope  that  these  hasty  notes  I  have  just  dictated  do  not  exhaust  this  book  and  that  its  dreams  go  on  branching  out  in  the  hospitable  imagination  of  those  who  now  close  it.   J.  L.  B.   Buenos  Aires,  February  3,  1975    !25    JORGE  LUIS  BORGES  is  the  author  of  many  distinguished  volumes  of  short  fiction,  poetry  and  essays,  including  The  Aleph  and  Other  Stories  7933-7969,  In  Praise  of  Darkness,  and  The  Universal  History  of  Infamy.  He  has  been  awarded  the  Jerusalem  Prize,  the  Interna-  tional Literary  Prize  and  dozens  of  honorary  degrees.  Now  in  his  late  seventies  and  almost  totally  blind,  Borges  continues  to  write,  to  travel  and  to  lecture.  He  lives  in  Buenos  Aires  and  frequently  visits  the  United  States.    NORMAN  THOMAS  Dl  GIOVANNI,  who  to  date  has  produced  English  versions  of  eight  books  by  Borges,  lives  in  Devon,  England.  He  worked  with  Borges  in  Buenos  Aires  from  1968  to  1972.
