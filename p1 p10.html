He stood up tall as he opened the top drawer of the high  writing cabinet. For a moment his back was again turned to me. I had the revolver  ready. I fired with the utmost care: Albert fell without a murmur, at once. I swear  that his death was instantaneous, as if he had been struck by lightning.   What remains is unreal and unimportant. Madden broke in and arrested me. I have  been condemned to hang. Abominably, I have yet triumphed! The secret name of the  city to be attacked got through to Berlin. Yesterday it was bombed. I read the news  in the same English newspapers which were trying to solve the riddle of the murder  of the learned Sinologist Stephen Albert by the unknown Yu Tsun. The Chief,  however, had already solved this mystery. He knew that my problem was to shout,  with my feeble voice, above the tumult of war, the name of the city called Albert,  and that I had no other course open to me than to kill someone of that name. He  does not know, for no one can, of my infinite penitence and sickness of the heart.    ' A malicious and outlandish statement.

Madden, in self defense, had inflicted wounds of which the spy later died. - Note by  the manuscript editor.
