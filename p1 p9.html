            <p>At one time, Ts'ui Pen  must have said; 'I am going into seclusion to write a book,' and at another, 'I am  retiring to construct a maze.' Everyone assumed these were separate activities. No  one realized that the book and the labyrinth were one and the same. The Pavilion of  the Limpid Sun was set in the middle of an intricate garden. This may have suggested  the idea of a physical maze.   "Ts'ui Pen died. In all the vast lands which once belonged to your family, no one  could find the labyrinth. The novel's confusion suggested that it was the labyrinth.   Two circumstances showed me the direct solution to the problem. First, the curious  legend that Ts'ui Pen had proposed to create an infinite maze, second, a fragment of  a letter which I discovered."   Albert rose. For a few moments he turned his back to me. He opened the top  drawer in the high black and gilded writing cabinet. He returned holding in his hand a  piece of paper which had once been crimson but which had faded with the passage  of time: it was rose colored, tenuous, quadrangular. Ts'ui Pen's calligraphy was justly  famous. Eagerly, but without understanding, I read the words which a man of my  own blood had written with a small brush: "I leave to various future times, but not  to all, my garden of forking paths."

            <p>I handed back the sheet of paper in silence. Albert went on:"Before I discovered this letter, I kept asking myself how a book could be infinite. I  could not imagine any other than a cyclic volume, circular. A volume whose last page  would be the same as the first and so have the possibility of continuing indefinitely. I  recalled, too, the night in the middle of The Thousand and One Nights when Queen  Scheherezade, through a magical mistake on the part of her copyist, started to tell  the story of The Thousand and One Nights, with the risk of again arriving at the  night upon which she will relate it, and thus on to infinity. I also imagined a Platonic  hereditary work, passed on from father to son, to which each individual would add a  new chapter or correct, with pious care, the work of his elders.   "These conjectures gave me amusement, but none seemed to have the remotest  application to the contradictory chapters of Ts'ui Pen. At this point, I was sent from  Oxford the manuscript you have just seen.   "Naturally, my attention was caught by the sentence, 'I leave to various future times,  but not to all, my garden of forking paths: I had no sooner read this, than I  understood.

    <p>In the second, the same army passes through a  palace where a banquet is in progress. The splendor of the feast remained a memory  throughout the glorious battle, and so victory followed.   With proper veneration I listened to these old tales, although perhaps with less  admiration for them in themselves than for the fact that they had been thought out  by one of my own blood, and that a man of a distant empire had given them back to    6     me, in the last stage of a desperate adventure, on a Western island. I remember the  final words, repeated at the end of each version like a secret command: "Thus the  heroes fought, with tranquil heart and bloody sword. They were resigned to killing  and to dying."   At that moment I felt within me and around me something invisible and intangible  pullulating. It was not the pullulation of two divergent, parallel, and finally converging  armies, but an agitation more inaccessible, more intimate, prefigured by them in  some way. Stephen Albert continued:   "I do not think that your illustrious ancestor toyed idly with variations.

     <p>I do not find  it believable that he would waste thirteen years laboring over a never ending  experiment in rhetoric. In your country the novel is an inferior genre; in Ts'ui Pen's  period, it was a despised one. Ts'ui Pen was a fine novelist but he was also a man of  letters who, doubtless, considered himself more than a mere novelist. The testimony  of his contemporaries attests to this, and certainly the known facts of his life confirm  his leanings toward the metaphysical and the mystical. Philosophical conjectures take  up the greater part of his novel. I know that of all problems, none disquieted him  more, and none concerned him more than the profound one of time. Now then, this  is the only problem that does not figure in the pages of The Garden. He does not  even use the word which means time. How can these voluntary omissions be  explained?"   I proposed various solutions, all of them inadequate.

    <p>We discussed them. Finally  Stephen Albert said: "In a guessing game to which the answer is chess, which word is  the only one prohibited?" I thought for a moment and then replied:   "The word is chess."   "Precisely," said Albert. "The Garden of Forking Paths is an enormous guessing game,  or parable, in which the subject is time. The rules of the game forbid the use of the  word itself. To eliminate a word completely, to refer to it by means of inept phrases  and obvious paraphrases, is perhaps the best way of drawing attention to it. This,  then, is the tortuous method of approach preferred by the oblique Ts'ui Pen in every  meandering of his interminable novel.

        <p>I have gone over hundreds of manuscripts, I  have corrected errors introduced by careless copyists, I have worked out the plan  from this chaos, I have restored, or believe I have restored, the original. I have  translated the whole work. I can state categorically that not once has the word time  been used in the whole book.   "The explanation is obvious. The Garden of Forking Paths is a picture, incomplete  yet not false, of the universe such as Ts'ui Pen conceived it to be.

        <p>Differing from  Newton and Schopenhauer, your ancestor did not think of time as absolute and  uniform. He believed in an infinite series of times, in a dizzily growing, ever spreading  network of diverging, converging and parallel times. This web of time - the strands of  which approach one another, bifurcate, intersect or ignore each other through the  centuries - embraces every possibility. We do not exist in most of them. In some  you exist and not I, while in others I do, and you do not, and in yet others both of us  exist. In this one, in which chance has favored me, you have come to my gate. In  another, you, crossing the garden, have found me dead. In yet another, I say these  very same words, but am an error, a phantom."

<p>  "In all of them," I enunciated, with a tremor in my voice. "I deeply appreciate and am  grateful to you for the restoration of Ts'ui Pen's garden."   "Not in all," he murmured with a smile. "Time is forever dividing itself toward  innumerable futures and in one of them I am your enemy."   Once again I sensed the pullulation of which I have already spoken. It seemed to me  that the dew-damp garden surrounding the house was infinitely saturated with  invisible people. All were Albert and myself, secretive, busy and multiform in other  dimensions of time. I lifted my eyes and the short nightmare disappeared. In the  black and yellow garden there was only a single man, but this man was as strong as a  statue and this man was walking up the path and he was Captain Richard Madden.
